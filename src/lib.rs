//! Library implementing solvers for linear and quadratic modular equations.
//!
//! As it's described in Wikipedia, modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic
//! where elements of the system (i.e., integers) wrap around after reaching
//! a specific boundary value called modulus.
//!
//! Before giving a concrete definition for such arithmetic system the following
//! relation needs to be stated: Given a positive integer M > 1, integer x is said
//! to be congruent to integer y, if M divides their difference (mathematically written
//! as M | (x - y)). In this case integers x and y are in a relation which is denoted
//! as x â‰¡ y (mod modu) and importantly this relation is an equivalence relation.
//!
//! Finally, the modular arithmetic system is constructed such that the elements of it
//! are so called residue or congruence classes [x] consisting of all the integers congruent
//! to x modulo M, or in other words all integers of the form {..., x - M, x, x + M, ...} =
//! {x + k * M}, k being a integer belonging to Z. Hence, in principle, all of these integers
//! are valid representatives of their residue class [x] but the common way is to use
//! the smallest nonnegative integer (modulo M) to represent the residue class. Congruence
//! relation was mentioned to be an equivalence relation and thus every integer can belong
//! to only one residue class modulo M.
//!
//! When listing all possible residue classes modulo M, a set of classes {[0], [1], ..., [M - 1]}
//! more precisely, and equipping this set with addition and multiplication operations (operations
//! are basically functions), the ring of integers modulo M (residue classes) is formed.
//! This ring is commonly denoted as Z/nZ where n the is modulo. Mentioned binary operations
//! are well-defined due to the fact that congruence relation is an equivalence relation. If the
//! modulo is a prime number, the ring becomes actually a field. These fields are more easier
//! to work with since every nonzero elements have a multiplicative inverse.
//!
//! In the context of rings or fields, it's meaningful to speak of equations and this library
//! implements solvers for linear and quadratic equations.
